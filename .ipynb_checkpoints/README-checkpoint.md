README for topic classification

# Solution Description

## Business problem

We have customers who are interested in domain-specific analyses of documents in these fields:

- medicine
- space
- cryptography
- electronics

We intend to tag our document stream (of news articles, blogs, social media postings) with these topics so that we can identify subsets of articles for more intensive domain-specific processing.

Please implement a topic classifier and compare it to a baseline such as a logistic regression classifier. Which, if either, is better? Which should we productionize?

## Evaluating the classifiers



## Otimizing your classifier
## Ensuring the research is reproducible and fit for sharing
## Scaling and generalizing
